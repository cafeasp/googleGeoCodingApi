# googleGeoCodingApi
Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.
This code is base on Google https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro using basic javascript and I will use .net on the backend/server.

To use the Google Maps Geocoding API, you need an API key.

This project will include a library class that will give you a way to start your own projects. Google gives the option to output XML or JSON. I would recommend to use JSON as you make request to the api.
